# ReactWeatherApp
Gets weather by city using React

Don't get too excited, eager public - it doesn't work yet.

EZ - 
The Form component should be calling the getWeather function which will deliver the data object that has all the weather data.
However, its acting like its not getting called and trying to render the weatherTable component which hasn't received the properties yet from
the getWeather function.  So, the properties end up as undefined.
